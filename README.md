# Bash Hunter

A collection of bash scripts that I've been creating along my learning process.

These scripts are tools I believe could be able to have some functionality in your everyday bug-hunting tasks. Each one has a specific purpose. Usually, these scripts are created when I have the need to automate a process, or when I want to better understand a concept or a tool that I commonly use. 

If you believe these may be useful for you, feel free to take them, test them, and do whatever you want with them! The goal here is that we all learn and improve together as a whole!

Cheers to you all!
